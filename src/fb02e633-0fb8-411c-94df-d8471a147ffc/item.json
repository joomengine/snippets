Checkboxes are for selecting one or several options in a list, while radios are for selecting one option from many.\r\n\r\nDisabled checkboxes and radios are supported, but to provide a not-allowed cursor on hover of the parent , you\u2019ll need to add the .disabled class to the parent .form-check. The disabled class will also lighten the text color to help indicate the input\u2019s state.",
