Choose from fixed to the top, fixed to the bottom, or stickied to the top (scrolls with the page until it reaches the top, then stays there). Fixed navbars use position: fixed, meaning they\u2019re pulled from the normal flow of the DOM and may require custom CSS (e.g., padding-top on the ) to prevent overlap with other elements.\r\n\r\nAlso note that .sticky-top uses position: sticky, which isn\u2019t fully supported in every browser.",
